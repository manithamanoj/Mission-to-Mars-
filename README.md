# Mission-to-Mars-
Web scraping
## Introduction
In this Challenge, we are going to scrape images of Mars’s hemispheres online from a scraping friendly site and adding those to our web app. We use  BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

### Analysis 
We use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles from the website https://marshemispheres.com/ 




Next we update scraping.py file, update Mongo database, and modify index.html file. So, the new webpage contains all the information that we have collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image. 

Then we update index.html file by adding Bootsrap3 components so the website is mobile-responsive.
